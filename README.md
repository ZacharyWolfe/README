## About me

Mission Statement: Full-time student and hobbyist software developer with interests of pursuing a career in software or data engineering. Experienced with several programming languages, data structures, and leveraging novel patterns to deliver efficient outcomes. I believe leadership is possible from all roles
and levels; I strive to contribute to cultures of growth and productivity at work and in my professional communities.

I'm a Sophomore studying Computer Science at **Ohio University Athens** with interests in databases, servers, low-level computation, mobile applications, and new technologies. Additionally, I'm pursuing a Mathematics minor and expect to graduate in **May 2026**.
